# Creating a test from scratch

This week we were tasked with creating a quiz from scratch. We needed add a score function, a timer ( with a function that removes time for incorrect answers ), and each correct and wrong answer needed to be stored in local storage for a scoreboard. While I went right in and created my HTML and CSS, I really struggles with the javascript this week.
